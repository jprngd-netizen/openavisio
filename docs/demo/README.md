## User accounts (demo instance)

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|

| `caregiver@demo.openavisio.org` | `Demo123!Care` | Caregiver (Anna Hoffmann, Lena's mother) |

## Workflows

### Local development — upload manually

The PDFs in `docs/demo/` are committed to the repo. Upload them through the normal UI to
exercise the full Processing Pipeline locally:

1. Log in as the dev admin (`admin@openavisio.dev` / `Admin123!Admin` after running `/api/dev/seed`)
2. Create a Patient, then upload each PDF from `docs/demo/`
3. The pipeline runs, extracts clinical data, and generates embeddings

### Demo instance — seed script

Run once after deploy (from the repo root):

```
cd backend
pip install -e .
cd ..

# Required env vars
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host/db"
export DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<base64-32-bytes>"
export DOCUMENT_STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/document/storage"

python scripts/seed_demo.py
```

The script is idempotent — re-running it when Lena Hoffmann already exists is a no-op.

### Regenerating PDFs

If the document content changes, regenerate the PDFs and commit them:

```
cd backend && pip install -e . && cd ..
python scripts/generate_demo_pdfs.py
```

### Regenerating embeddings

If the embedding model or document text changes, regenerate and commit the embeddings file:

```
AI_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8001 python scripts/generate_demo_embeddings.py
```

Then commit `scripts/demo_data/embeddings.json` and re-run `seed_demo.py`.

## What must be updated when things change

| Change | Files to update |
|--------|----------------|
| Embedding model changes (new model or dimension ≠ 768) | Regenerate `scripts/demo_data/embeddings.json`; update dimension note in ADR 019 |
| Demo document text changes | `scripts/generate_demo_pdfs.py`, chunk texts in `scripts/seed_demo.py`, then regenerate PDF and embeddings |
| `DocumentChunk` schema changes | `scripts/seed_demo.py` |
| `DocumentReference` field added/renamed | `scripts/seed_demo.py` |
| Pipeline extraction format changes (new entity type, renamed field) | `scripts/seed_demo.py` — the hardcoded clinical data records mirror what the pipeline would have produced |
| Clinical data models change (`Condition`, `MedicationStatement`, `Observation`, `Incident`, `CalendarEvent`, `Recommendation`) | `scripts/seed_demo.py` |
| New Correspondent needed | `scripts/seed_demo.py` (add to `CORRESPONDENTS` constant) |

## Embeddings note

The pre-generated embeddings in `scripts/demo_data/embeddings.json` still pair with
the original English chunk texts. With the demo's mock AI backend that is invisible;
if semantic search on a demo instance ever matters, re-run
`generate_demo_embeddings.py` against a real backend after the German rewrite.
